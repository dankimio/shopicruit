# Shopicruit
You've discovered the Shopify Store 'Shopicruit'. Since you're obsessed with computers, you want to buy every single computer and keyboard variant they have to offer. Unfortunately you can only carry up to 100kg and may not be able to buy all of them. By inspecting the JavaScript calls on the store you discovered that the shop lists products at http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json. Write a program that calculates what the maximum amount of computers and keyboards that you could carry would cost you.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Run the script:

```bash
$ ruby shopicruit.rb
```
